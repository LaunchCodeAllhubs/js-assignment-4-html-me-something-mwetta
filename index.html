      <h1>About Tarot</h1>
      <p>
         Tarot originated in Europe. Originally used for games, tarot cards were adopted by occultists for divination
         and cartomancy. In modern times, tarot can be used as a reflective tool to focus attention to certain areas of
         one's life.

      <h2 id="name">The Fool</h2>
      <p id="interpretation">The grand adventure begins! The fearless Fool with their devil-may-care attitude is
         ready
         to take the first
         steps
         towards the unknown. Pure passion and optimism fuel them as they dances to their music, to joy itself. They
         don't
         know what lies beyond the cliff's edge, but they've left behind their life in the city. Goodbye to normalcy,
         to
         routine, to the structured life they'd had within society. They fully trusts their instincts to carry them
         beyond
         the ordinary.</p>
      <h2>What does this card mean for you?</h2>
      <p id="meaning">Don't be afraid to take that leap of faith. Now is the time for you to start your journey,
         because
         you're
         ready. Be spontaneous and let your wildness run free. Don't look back in fear, look ahead and up to the sky
         and
         sun and let your instincts guide you.</p>
